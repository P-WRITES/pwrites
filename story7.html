               <p class="one">5 ululations for a boy and 4 for a girl. This is/was a cultural practice for an African community,
                 Gikuyu, every time a child was born. The lives of boys and girls were different right from birth in many ways.
                  Other than informing the father, who was not allowed near the midwife`s hut, the ululations expressed the importance
                   of the boy`s life to the continuation and well being of the community. From birth the young lad had a burden to
                    bear as a man.
                 He could not escape being strong and stoic rest he would be disregarded and disrespected.
                </p>
              <p class="two">
                For as much as history holds, or what I know, men had and have to become. They have to work their way up 
                to a certain level in life to earn their place and respect. Every man, in one way or another, has had to/will
                 have to prove himself worthy to the society. Men will have to handle their problems head on and have to remain
                  strong. If not for themselves then for others. Many are those who had to work so hard to achieve their success.
                   The lucky ones who had wealthy families had to learn how to manage their family property or
                 know a thing or two about how everything works. Unless their parents decided to watch them become losers.  
              </p>
                  <p class="three">
                    As G. Michael wrote in his novel `those who remain` “Hard times create strong men, 
                    strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times.” Our 
                    ancestors had hard times, they had to be strong and they built what we have now. Lucky for us that 
                    the times are good. That’s not the case for the future. Men are becoming weaker and weaker with generations. 
                    Gen Z is pretty messed up.
                     This trend promises no good to the future. But of course the future is ‘female’ . Damn world!

              </p>
                  <p class="four">
                    There is a number of causes to a boom in the number of weak men. Among them but not limited to
                     lack of role models/ mentors, lack of a father figure in life and radicle feminism that’s telling
                      young boys that being masculine is toxic. What kind of a society can thrive with emasculated men? 
                       A fair number of historical events clearly illustrate the effects of lack of masculine men in the society.
                        Well, the lefties argue that it was because of the patriarchy which was only bad when women were not leading 
                        but was good when men died working and protecting them. Certainly the system then had its own downsides
                         regarding gender equality but however much some people may make it look toxic,
                     none of the current societies would have made it without masculinity at its peak.

               </p>
                  <p class="five">
                    There are men and who are willing to mentor young boys into men but unfortunately, they are called
                     toxic and sexist when they say facts. Social media has made it very easy to trash a person who is 
                     making sensible comments and opinions about sensitive matters such as this one but praise some morons
                      who say absolute bullshit all the time. Women who challenge men to be their best are also trashed and
                       called stupid. 
                    That’s what happens when we let the stupid ones determine who is stupid.

              </p>
              <p class="six">
                Some mothers will deny a son`s father access to his son. For whatever its worth that boy might end up being 
                a goddamn asshole if not in prison.  Several millions of such men in the future and the world is doomed.
                 For Christ`s sake, most of the problems we have right now, talk of relationships and the entitlement in 
                 some women has been brought about by weak men who simp and entertain some dramatic nonsense from them. 
                 These bastards will ruin everything. Weak men who don’t know their value and worth, who are not driven,
                  focused and discipline will mess the world up more than it is now.
                 I feel like they need a good ass whopping to instill some sense into them.

        </p>
            <p class="seven">
                Boys are chasing after girls instead of working to better themselves and the society.
                 Some of these bastards will even waste time, money and energy going after someone who might
                  leave them at the very opportunity of meeting a chad instead of chasing after their dreams 
                  and goals. Others are messing up with their minds by watching too much porn and masturbating 
                  and this affects their brains, precisely the reward system and this makes many lazy and incapable
                   of actual relationship when need be. Simps are giving women validation on social media day 
                   in day out and this make these women so entitled yet they don’t deserve anything to be honest. 
                   Others are into drugs and they bail themselves out saying they are having fun when in reality,
                    every day the society is losing men. on the other hand radicle feminism is working committedly to
                     ensure that boys are emasculated at a young age. All for a stupid call to make #the future is female
                      to work. I wish someone would tell them early enough that there is no future without men.
                It`s tough being a man but once born male, you must embrace masculinity and reject modernity. Stoicism
                 is not a choice, its mandatory! Men must support one another to raise men or else the society will be
                  screwed in the next few years. Many things such as wokeness among and towards men should not be 
                  tolerated. The same case to any man being a bitch.
                BRUV , BE A MAN!
