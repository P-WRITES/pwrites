          <h1 class="story">STORY !</h1>
          <div class="card">
              <h1 class="head">IT'S ON YOU DEAR</h1>
               <p class="one"> Am a strong believer that every person’s life depends significantly on their choices.
                 Any person of sane mind and of age to make
                 their own life choices should not blame other people for their wrong choices and doings. 
                </p>
              <p class="two">
                More often than not human beings choose the easier way in life to either avoid the pain of admitting that 
                they screwed up or to avoid responsibility and accountability, and blaming others for one’s wrong choices is a
                 perfect example of the easy way.  Unfortunately, the universe is unforgiving and will always catch up with a person.
                  Well, a good argument can and will be made that other people and society in general has impact on everyone’s life.
                   The argument is undoubtfully true. However in the long run, 
                life will always hold you accountable for every choice and decision made be it good or bad.

              </p>
                  <p class="three">
                    Trauma is a part of life and different people handle it differently.
                     People of all walks in life have been traumatized or frustrated about this and the other.
                      Some became better, stronger and more experienced while others used the trauma as an excuse to bail
                       themselves out of their wrong choices. At first people might understand and put up with  this kind of people
                        in an attempt to express their sympathy to them. The trick is that years later, you cannot bail yourself out
                         of the consequences, 
                    which more likely than not one will face alone.


              </p>
                  <p class="four">
                    Its easier to get into drugs and substance abuse when feeling low and frustrated.
                     However, as much as some people may understand your situation at the time, years later nobody cares
                      let alone remember what your issues were. Society will judge you depending on your situation then and 
                      what has become of you. Suppose something traumatizing occurs to 20year-old young man and he gets into
                       drugs at that age. We all know how addictive some of this hard-drugs are and the difficulty to quitting 
                       once one has started using them. 20 years later, nobody will care about what happened to that guy leading
                        him to drug abuse. The society will automatically brand him a loser and the truth be told, that’s what he will be. Now the question is, was that 
                    one-time situation worth enough to ruin an entire lifetime for?

               </p>
                  <p class="five">
                    I have come across a scenario where a young woman slept around with many men in her prime(late teens and 20’s) 
                    and bailed herself out of being a hoe by saying that she had daddy issues. Truth be told, men understood that, 
                    before and during sex but after that, none did. To her, I suppose she was punishing the father or maybe being a 
                    strong woman. Years down the line and she want to get married and settle. Nobody _unless a simp_ is willing to 
                    wife her. Many are interested in hooking up and one night-stand but won’t be willing to commit to her due to her 
                    promiscuous past.
                     They call her a hoe and say she has a lot of emotional baggage. Which is absolutely true. 

              </p>
              <p class="six">
                The issue is, by this time in her life, no one gives a shit about her daddy issues.
                 Her choices determine her fate and that’s it. Chances are, she is doomed! It’s at this moment that
                  she realizes that the society does not care, especially when it comes to such matters where she has
                   little or no power to control whoever will choose to settle with her. I mean, it hits hard to know that 
                   in the first place she had daddy issues because her own father did not care.
                 That’s how messed up the situation becomes and the truth hits that darling, you screwed yourself up!

        </p>
            <p class="seven">
                To wrap it up, shit happens in life. One cannot always be happy, but whatever you do after a 
                frustrating or traumatizing event is entirely on you. It’s stupid to mess up with the better part 
                
                of your life because of a scenario however bad it may be. You may want people to understand and feel
                 your pain but at times they don’t. And even if they do, a day is coming and they won’t give a fuck. 
             You owe its to yourself to heal after being wounded. Otherwise, you will do
             some stupid things and guess what, you will face the consequences and that will be on you dear.
