              <h1 class="head">THE BEGINNING OF THE END</h1>
               <p class="one">People evolve and things change with time. The society has been more `informed` in the past 
                number of years maybe more than it ever was. See how they say that too much of anything is poisonous ?
                 It turns out that all that knowledge/information is poisoning the society. Without doubt, its dying from within.
                  Consuming itself gradually turning itself in a living dead. I am not convinced that I make very good judgements
                   but I can confidently say, without fear of contradiction,
                 that somehow people are becoming more naïve and silly as days go by.  
                </p>
              <p class="two">
                We can all agree that more often than not, the outcome of an action or movement matters more
                 that the intention behind doing it. Doing something with good intentions does not guarantee good 
                 results and neither does the latter. 
                Movements have been set in motion all over the world intended to bring good outcome but the aftermath is
                 nothing close to the anticipated one. Some have had detrimental results to the society and thus the particular civilization involved. Condoning all sorts of perceptions, including those than have and can be proven to be absurd and absolutely senseless, have and is leading the society to such dark places that mildly predict downfall in a number of years to come.

              </p>
                  <p class="three">
                    A movement with an intention to revive internal peace, relief and ease trauma to victims of rape
                     has given birth to one that’s encouraging murder through abortion. They call a living being a clump of 
                     cells and others just an embryo. Surprisingly even medical experts are willing to make fools out of themselves 
                     and support this knowing very well when life begins. At conception. Aborting a baby just  a month before birth 
                     has been made by some very right and they shamelessly try to justify it as moral. It’s heartbreaking watching 
                     human beings devalue their very own origin. 
                    We say we are wiser than animals but some actions can’t support that thesis.

              </p>
                  <p class="four">
                    The so-called inclusion has led to the overlooking of the rights and freedoms of specific groups of people.
                     The society is willing to kill and destroy all female spaces by allowing as bunch of dudes into them spaces.
                      Sports, washrooms, locker-rooms, prisons and even in the female hygiene and sanitation industries.
                       Its ridiculous that a man who has never experienced and has little knowledge about menstruation is allowed 
                       to advertise about sanitary products as a ‘woman’. Female world records  in sports might all be held by biological
                        males in the next few years. Women who have worked so hard to achieve success in their respective sporting
                         activities are helplessly watching guys break their records as if they were a walk in the park. sadly these ladies are forced to bear with such. All this to please a group of people that talk of inclusion and are 
                    unwilling to acknowledge differences in the sexes only to benefit at the expense of women..

               </p>
                  <p class="five">
                    Talk of body positivity. One of a kind movement meant for injured solders, victims of war and other tragedies 
                    that affect their physicality. Not today. Something that began with pure intentions out of love and care has 
                    been turned into the foundation to which being obese, fat, unhealthy and out of shape is built on. The society 
                    cares more about making people feel good more than upholding facts and addressing matters as real as they are.
                     Many argue that these people should be left alone since it`s their life and health, but what good would an 
                     unhealthy person be to the society.
                     A lot of potential is wasted since they are less active thus less productive.

              </p>
              <p class="six">
                They talk of feminism. Initially a movement to fight for women rights and empower them to make their
                 impact and contribution acknowledged in the society. It was intended for good until they turned it into a men
                 hating cult and a nuke to the family. It has successfully convinced women that career is the way to go 
                 for life fulfillment. It has also gradually succeeded in emasculating men and killing femininity, the
                  very crucial aspects for a society to thrive yet try to prove of how female the future is. That’s an
                   equivalent of setting C4s at the basement of a 50 floor building and
                 then find your way to the 50th floor to detonate the bombs thinking that you will be very safe yourself.

        </p>
            <p class="seven">
                We are living in a society that is praising all wrong doings. Drug abuse is having fun,
                 promiscuity is being empowered, being obese is self-love, murder  is a disposal of some cells
                  clamps and many other outrageous opinions that are now making the so called new order.
                 If not corrected, this is most certainly the beginning of the end. 
        </p>
