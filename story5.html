               <p class="one">Have you heard of the freedom of speech? The right to free speech?
                 Other than the fact that these days it only exists when you say what a certain group of people 
                 agree with (even when you are absolutely right), what else do you know about it. It’s unfathomable
                  how a minority of people who are not ready to accept facts or logic control what others will say. 
                  They demonize anyone who says anything they don’t agree with, facts or not, yet talk of freedom to 
                  speech when called out after making ridiculous points.
                 Some have tried to own some parts of the language. 
                </p>
              <p class="two">
                It’s easier to laugh at the absurdity of the double standards that exist
                 in the society. How did we get to the point where a person can confidently 
                 say that men are completely useless and should be gotten rid of but a simple
                  point of correction to a certain woman is oppression. A female celeb will say that men 
                  don’t even deserve to have a penis in a live tv show and she is called strong,
                 but when a man says that men need to have standards and value themselves, he is toxic

              </p>
                  <p class="three">
                    Funny how a cheating woman is a bad bitch but a cheating man is trash. 
                    Well yeah, he may deserve that for cheating, but why praise promiscuity for women. 
                    Funny that admitting to the fact that men are better than women in certain fields is sexist but
                     a woman saying that they are better than men in everything (everything is never defined) and the world
                      needs no men/the future is female is not. Calling men trash and dogs makes one a bad bitch but calling out
                       a woman for her wrong doings is patronizing. 
                    Hitting a man is being strong but when they hit back its abuse



              </p>
                  <p class="four">
                    There are many examples of double standards. Of course some go the other way but I would wish to get examples
                     from you people. I wonder how many take a moment to think about the effects of sugarcoating every wrong deed 
                     just to make a certain group happy. How many ever think about the aftermath of all this drama. Does the question, 
                     who is to blame ever come up? And if it does, what’s the answer. Is it the government for encouraging such. Is it the radicle feminism, 
                    is it the society for tolerating that or is it men for just sitting down and watch all these happen

               </p>
                  <p class="five">
                    Am not pointing fingers at anybody. 
                    The truth is, unless all parties involved come up with a working solution, the future is most certainly doomed!
