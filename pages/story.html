<body>
    <p>. It`s been exactly 20 years 2 months 8 days since I was born and up to
         <br>this date I can stand and say that God has been with me through every
         <br>step of my life even when I was as and He protected me through everything. 
         <br>I know I have a very long journey to go in life and I only pray that God is 
         <br>going to be with me through every step of the journey so that finally I will end 
          <br>up succeeding in life. It happens that I have big dreams in life that I can to some 
          <br>point say have a very huge impact on my life. They define me and give me a purpose 
          <br>in life. As of today 2nd January, 2023 I embark on a journey that is going transform
          <br>everything I dream about to make a reality and bit by bit I am sure I will make it 
          <br>all come true. This I write before I begin moving to be a milestone about the whole
          <br>story that I will ell someday in the future of the first step I took in life.<br> 
        Ibegin by reading books and training on articles writing, studying HTML and working out.

        <br>THE BOY WAS KNOWN AS PETER MAINA MUNDIA AND HE GREW UP IN A SMALL
        <br>VILAGE IN KIANGAI IANWE. The funny thig about life is that we have
        <br>some people who honestly
        <br>refuse to use their brains ta all and wish to remain as empty vessels.
        <br>Its quite sad how some people like messing around and becoming peaces of shit every 
        <br>now and then and when yoy think about it you find out how lame some people can actually be.. 
        I
        <br> have a story that I want to write. The story will moist certainly
        <br>piss a lot of people off especially when they know that they are just lame and stupid.. 
        
        <br>Thinking is a gift that not many people have beeb blessed withâ€¦ its absurd but whatever men
        
        <br>Please Help Me
