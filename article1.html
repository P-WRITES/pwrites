              <h1 class="head">.WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN…</h1>
               <p class="one">From a vantage point up the hill, he could see the entirety of the city`s lights 
                and the compelling view of car headlights as they moved in the traffic.
                 The cold air hit his face calming him down, and the wind gushed against him making his light t-shirt flap. 
                 The chirping of crickets, frogs croaking and distance sound of dogs barking calmed his nerves.
                  His eyelids smoothly dropped and shut, consequently drifting him into his own world of imagination.
                  He was into his past, re-living some moments and creating others that were never actually there. 
                   Instinctively Tyler craved love and affection but the pain and unresolved trauma propelled him to different directions.
                </p>
              <p class="two">It has been twenty years now. Yeah, twenty years of dreaming and 
                aspiring yet nothing ever seemed to go his way. Two hours after his birth, Mary 
                passed on leaving behind this poor kid at the mercies of the merciless universe.
                 Her end marked the beginning of a different path of life for Tyler that started 
                 unfolding then and still seems to be unfolding to date. He has very few memories 
                 about his childhood other than the imagination of what life could have been, and the
                  bad ones outnumber the good memories.
  
              </p>
                  <p class="three">
                    He is being taught how to swim, during one of the many sunny days, later busking 
                    in the sun while covering his eyes with thinly sliced pieces of lemon. Learning 
                    how to ride a bicycle, crushing on to the tree outside his home, into the bushes 
                    or at times falling and grinding along the tarmacked pavements near the house and
                     his parents would pick him up and clean his wounds while encouraging him.
                      His four siblings would laugh and mock him for being such a loser. Mary would 
                      swing him on the recently green-painted swings at the backyard and the duo 
                      would laugh out loud. The kid would try to swing his mother but his tiny weak 
                      hands could not carry an eighth of his robust mom`s weight.
                       She still encouraged him though. You know how mothers are.


              </p>
                  <p class="four">
                    Josy would always come home bearing gifts for his lastborn child. The siblings
                     would be envy. They had their time though.  The nearly bald-headed dad would pick
                      his child and play with him. He encouraged Tyler`s brother to take him fishing,
                       bird hunting and into the woods for adventure. The boy enjoyed the serene 
                       environment outside his home. Occasionally the family sat beside a camp, talked 
                       for hours at night before going to bed. looking at the moon was fun than watching
                        the sun set to them.

               </p>
                  <p class="five">
                    All these imaginations are countered by the brutal reality of emptiness and the nearly 
                    tangible helplessness he has grown up with. The what could have been love is neutralized 
                    by the hatred he is told was directed to him and the one he has experienced in his short
                     miserable lifetime. Tyler hated every bit of being treated as if Mary`s demise was his 
                     fault. He tried carrying that burden for so long. Well, he hit a breaking point at one time.

              </p>
              <p class="six">
                “I watched her body gradually become lifeless despite her attempts to fight death,” his elder sister
                 had told him, “Father and the nurses held her down to her bed to at least grant her the courtesy
                  of a calm death after bringing a fifth child to earth.” Tyler`s brother- who was four at the
                   time says he thought it was one of the many fights their parents had which always led to tears
                    and then their mother left. He saw the tears and the resting body and wasn`t bothered a bit.
                     Maxy, arguably not the smartest son of Josy, just thought the crying at the hospital waiting
                      bay was uncalled for.

        </p>
            <p class="seven">
                “Dad stood at her bedside, looking at her sternly as though very disappointed in
                 her. I bet he questioned her fight, possibly thinking she did not fight hard enough,”
                  the second born had told Tyler, “He slowly pocketed, veins popped up his forehead and
                   his eyes reddened before tears welled up. Only one eye dropped a tear though.”

                For as long as he could remember, Tyler questioned the adage ‘blood is thicker than
                 water’ every time it crossed his mind. All the so-called family had deserted them 
                 as soon as they lay flowers on their mother`s grave. Knowing that that’s the norm 
                 in the world was a consolation to him though. Josy in his brokenness never performed
                  both parental roles well. For a season he came home drunk and wasted. The eldest 
                  sibling officially became the new mother.
              
        </p>
                 
        <p class="eight">
            Tyler counts the many times he slept with an empty stomach while his aunt, 
            some steps from his house, had hosted one of those women parties and did not even consider 
            feeding them leftovers. The picture of him dressed in heavily torn dirty unfitting clothes 
            still lingers in his mind. Ming you his uncle managed and still owns one of the most successful 
            well-established boutiques in town. He had to bear the humiliation from his fellow mates at
             school due to his shoes. It was of those pairs with a family history having being passed on
              down the generations. It was definitely an oversize but he was not barefooted and that was
               good to him.
          
    </p>
             

       <p class="nine">
        Being a smart kid, he excelled fairly well academically. The boy worked hard to keep his
         mind occupied or maybe fill his hollows in life. Growing up as the odd one out Tyler had
          adapted to embracing loneliness, but one can only bear so much. He tried relationships, 
          didn’t work. Drugs did no goo either. The poor guy resolved to dreaming and hoping that 
          one day he will be saved from his mess by an angel. He wished never to be in such a position ever again.
           If wishes ever come to pass…
      
     </p>
         

     <p class="ten">
        This is one of the many nights he snaps out of sleep in the middle of the night. He 
        takes that chance to re-evaluate his life and dreams. How busy the town is at that time 
        of the night never ceases to amuse him. Nature was, however, not all inconsiderate. He 
        was given a chance to live in a small house at the middle of one of the hills surrounding
         their town. An opportunity to look at the busy ‘city’ and reminisce about his misery, what
          could have been of life and what might become of him in the unforeseen future.


        Tyler opened his eyes, now very red and nearly blind-sighted by tears, slowly turned 
        to go back in. with a fading smile, hopeful yet heavy heart, he went back to sleep, 
        decided to live a day at a time and praying for there to be light at the end of the 
        tunnel.
