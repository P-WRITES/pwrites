              From a distance you may think they have got a life or thier shit in order.
              But believe you me, you opt to think again or you'll be in for a rude shock.
              To be fair and just, on a good day they don't make soo much noise and on rare,
              very rare, situations they allow some sense in them and say some sensible things.
              In a nutshell, they are full of shit. Though they have soo many self created problems,
              it's a mystery how they have survived in this 'unfair,inconsiderate and patyriachal' world -as they call it...
              They are very traumatized that men built them the good world they live in. Why should any human being do such aterrible thing to them...
               "If they cannot handle us as we are,sorry that we are not sorry," said one blue hair colored friend,"we shaa get ourselves dogs and cats and age gracefully and happily!"
              The friend finished and walked away magestically with a better part of the pride and respect "they" command...</p>

                     Google defines delusional as having false or unrealistic beliefs or opinions
                     that are not changed by facts.
                    Unfortunately, its become very difficult to trust google especially now that it says 
                    that biological men can get pregnant. Nevertheless, trusted sources have several definitions of delusional.
                     Some worthy mentions if you please… it could mean a young lady sleeping around yet dreaming of getting a high
                      value man later in life after she lost all her value, or maybe a spoilt woman with nothing to offer in ...</p>

                     Any person of sane mind and of age to make

                     Unfortunately, the universe is unforgiving and will always catch up with a person.
                  Well, a good argument can and will be made that other people and society in general has impact on everyone’s life.
                   The argument is undoubtfully true. However in the long run, 
                life will always hold you accountable for every choice and decision made be it good or bad...</p>

             <h1 class="head">FEM….. WHAT?!</h1>
             This movement is bringing more harm than good to the society including to women. Funny enough,
              it’s not about women. No. its about those who agree with it coz those who don’t, men or women, 
              are all stupid, uncivilized and uninformed of the oppression of women. However, the oppression is 
              never clear. They complain of this and the other yet this and the other are nothing. Preferably, I call it a cult.
               People follow with or without reason and don’t want to be questioned. Its absurd though that even religion 
               that has existed for so 
             long is questioned but radicle feminism cannot, even when it is making no damn sense....</p>

             <h1 class="head">THE DS!</h1>
             ...It’s easier to laugh at the absurdity of the double standards that exist
             in the society. How did we get to the point where a person can confidently 
             say that men are completely useless and should be gotten rid of but a simple
              point of correction to a certain woman is oppression. A female celeb will say that men 
              don’t even deserve to have a penis in a live tv show and she is called strong,
             but when a man says that men need to have standards and value themselves, he is toxic...</p>

               <h1 class="head">THE BEGINNING OF THE END</h1>
               ...The so-called inclusion has led to the overlooking of the rights and freedoms of specific groups of people.
               The society is willing to kill and destroy all female spaces by allowing as bunch of dudes into them spaces.
                Sports, washrooms, locker-rooms, prisons and even in the female hygiene and sanitation industries.
                ...We are living in a society that is praising all wrong doings. Drug abuse is having fun,
                 promiscuity is being empowered, being obese is self-love, murder  is...</p>

                 <h1 class="head">..HE…</h1>
                 ...As G. Michael wrote in his novel `Those Who Remain` “Hard times create strong men, 
                 strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times.” Our 
                 ancestors had hard times, they had to be strong and they built what we have now. Lucky for us that 
                 the times are good. That’s not the case for the future. Men are becoming weaker and weaker with generations. 
                 Gen Z is pretty messed up.
                  This trend promises no good to the future. But of course the future is ‘female’ . Damn world!...</p>
