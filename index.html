              From a distance you may think they have got a life or thier shit in order.
              But believe you me, you opt to think again or you'll be in for a rude shock.
              To be fair and just, on a good day they don't make soo much noise and on rare,
              very rare, situations they allow some sense in them and say some sensible things.
              In a nutshell, they are full of shit. Though they have soo many self created problems,
              it's a mystery how they have survived in this 'unfair,inconsiderate and patyriachal' world -as they call it...
              They are very traumatized that men built them the good world they live in. Why should any human being do such aterrible thing to them...
               "If they cannot handle us as we are,sorry that we are not sorry," said one blue hair colored friend,"we shaa get ourselves dogs and cats and age gracefully and happily!"
              The friend finished and walked away magestically with a better part of the pride and respect "they" command...</p>

                     Google defines delusional as having false or unrealistic beliefs or opinions
                     that are not changed by facts.
                    Unfortunately, its become very difficult to trust google especially now that it says 
                    that biological men can get pregnant. Nevertheless, trusted sources have several definitions of delusional.
                     Some worthy mentions if you pleaseâ€¦ it could mean a young lady sleeping around yet dreaming of getting a high
                      value man later in life after she lost all her value, or maybe a spoilt woman with nothing to offer in ...</p>
