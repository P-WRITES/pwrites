          <div class="card">
              <h1 class="head">DELUSION AT ITS FINEST</h1>
               <p class="one"> Google defines delusional as having false or unrealistic beliefs or opinions
                 that are not changed by facts.
                Unfortunately, its become very difficult to trust google especially now that it says 
                that biological men can get pregnant. Nevertheless, trusted sources have several definitions of delusional.
                 Some worthy mentions if you pleaseâ€¦ it could mean a young lady sleeping around yet dreaming of getting a high
                  value man later in life after she lost all her value, or maybe a spoilt woman with nothing to offer in 
                  life wanting to get a high-value loyal man while clinging to that lame thought that she is the table,
                   or perhaps a woman who has already hit the 'wall' dreaming of getting married with all her 
                   emotional baggage and messed up past. I wish somebody would tell them to dream again.
                </p>
              <p class="two">
                Should we give google a benefit of the doubt and believe it, 
                then thinking that sacrificing a supper-power of making another life is you, as a woman, 
                for a shitty miserable life of working long hours trying to outsmart and outdo men only to prove a senseless 
                point is delusional.  It's unbelievably funny how the delusional ones think of themselves as empowered and informed. 
                Then fast forward a number of years down the line, there they are crying on tik-tok telling 
                people of how they are regretting what they did- like anyone cares about their messed-up life.
                 It's easier to buy dogs and just live life as they choose it.

              </p>
                  <p class="three">
                    Imagine starbucks or mcdonald's made some low-quality foodstuffs and tried to force you 
                    to consume them like they know what you want better than you do, that's what these delusional ones do.
                     For life's sake, do they even know what they want in life? One minute they are saying they don't conform to
                      traditional gender roles but then the other they want a man who will do all those traditional things to them
                       yet they still want him to have a feminine side. They want an emotionally available man but they don't care
                        about the man's feelings at all. Still, emotionally available men are called nice guys and they finish last all
                     the time,
                     that's if they won't have already been labelled as weak men or losers.

              </p>
                  <p class="four">
                    One moment they don't need men #kill all men, but then the other they are calling the passport bro's losers.
                     They want equality but draw the line where they are treated like men. They date fuck-boys and jerks only to 
                     complain later that they cannot find good men and after which #all men are trash. They consensually open their
                      legs and allow men through their pants but then complain of being disrespected when they are called according 
                      to what they do. They walk nearly naked, sexualize themselves and do all sorts of stupidity online but later they
                       say they are not taken seriously and that they are sexualized. They won't take care of their bodies and some cannot even find they cloth 
                    sizes in the mall yet they want to be rated as 10s on the beauty scale. SERIOUSLY !!!

                    Can someone tell me exactly what these people want.
