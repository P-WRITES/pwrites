            <h1 class="head">OUR BLUE HAIR FRIENDS </h1>
             <p class="one"> From a distance you may think they have got a life or thier theirs in order.
              But believe you me you opt to think again or you'll be in for a rude shock.
              To be fair and just, on a good day they don't make soo much noise and on rare,
              very rare, situations they allow some sense in them and say some sensible things.
              In a nutshell, they are full of shit. Though they have soo many self created problems,
              it's a mystery how they have survived in this 'unfair,inconsiderate and patyriachal' world -as they call it.
              I mean.. for life's sake how are they even expected to breathe on this world full of trouble and run by a patriachal tirrany.
              They are always lead as if they cannot handle responsibility and face concequences for their wrong choice.</p>
            <p class="two">
                Personally I am not very old let alone having life experiences, but in the short time I have lived I have seen victims.
                Yes ! Actual victims of very traumatizing events in life. I have witnessed some people suffer so much physical and psychological 
                torture that I almost got traumatized myself. There I am thinking that I have seen it all and the BOOM !! Comes our blue haired fellows.
                They are very traumatized that men built them the good world they live in. Why should any human being do such a terrible thing to them ?
            </p>
                <p class="three">
                    Some of this men even go to the extent of being gentlemen and showing chivary. Imagine such a dehumanising act of holding a door open for you.
                    Such victimisation direct to your face. Why do such a thing to a person yet they have hands, or should I say they are strong and independent?
                     I share their pain of knowing that those brutal,inhumane and inconsiderate men went to the point of creating the internet and some stupid groups 
                     of them invented the many social media platforms that our 'friends' use to mock them and call them out. Those useless pieces of sh*t. HOW COULD THEY !
            </p>
                <p class="four">
                    It's very sad that some of these untamed men will wake up every morning to go do hard jobs of maintaining the water and power systems for long hours.
                     Such deeds are extremely traumatizing and depressing to our 'friends'. They are so oppressed by this especially because we all know they don't need such. 
                     Don't we ? Take a moment and picture someone fixing your drainage system after it have failed in bad weather while you are in shelter recording them to post on social media.
                    Picture that same kind of a guy fixing your car after it has broken down. Imagine that a person can get into a house on flames to save a life.Just imagine 
                    that. Can you imagine the amount of pain our blue haired friends have to bare linving in a world with such kind of people ? Such loosers?
                    If you don't understand our 'friends' pain living around people who are willing to be such 'loosers', then you are a moron and you should be cancelled
                     effective immediatelly !
             </p>
                <p class="five">
                  This goddamn blue haired creatures don't need men. Not at all ! Men make their lives unbearable. They cannot stand the male cops coming to their rescue 
                  when their lives are threatened. Surprisingly they are the same people who call 911. Yet that doens not change the fact that men are not important. Does it ? 
                  The army and defence forces vets are no good to these 'friends'. How dare they protect their country. Those bastards ! I mean please ! Who does that. 
            </p>
                <p class="six">
                    Have you met those misagonistic,toxic and patronising men paying bills and buying free drinks and meals for this blue haired friends ? 
                    have you met those freaks who finance some of our 'friends' lifestyle through Onlyfans? Oops! My bad. The above characters, according to trustworthy sources are not 
                    as bad per say. But Hello ! Don't you even think about forgetting how controlling some men are. They want to control our 'friends' lives by saying they cannot wife an 
                    Onlyfan model.Some shamelessly say that body count matters in relationship. Thats the highest degree of toxicity and disregard to the rights of our 'friends'
                    Haven't somebody told these men that they don't have any right to have a single preferrence whatsoever ? What on earth were they learning when growing up ? 
                    Some one need to inform men about the rights of our blue colored hair friends and ofcourse explain to them what if means when these 'friends' say
                    "my body,my choice,my life."
            </p>
                <p class="seven">
                   Some of these misagonistic men cannot date +size 'friends'. They even body shame these +size 'friends' by calling them fat. Such men want to victimise the +size 'friends' yet those men are the victims.
                   The poor souls think that everyone is as uncapable of proper feeding and taking good care of their health as them. Shame on them! Men.... It,s unbelievable how dilusional some men are.
                   They will courageously ask our 'friends' what they bring on the table. Like DAAAAH !!! Don't they know who the table is. Morons
                   In a recent street interview, one of our blue color hair friends was asked what a 'friend' brings to the table. She could not help herself but to open her mouth and say nonsense.
                   "We are the table and the prize. If they cannot handle us as we are, sorry that we are not sorry," said the 'friend',"we shall get ourselves dogs and cats and age gracefully and happily !"
                   The 'friend' finished and walked away magestically with a better part of the pride and respect "they" command.
                What a world we live in !
