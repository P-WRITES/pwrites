              <h1 class="head">FEM….. WHAT?!</h1>
               <p class="one"> You may say am anti-feminism but honestly, I don’t think its even worth caring.
                 I cannot disregard or discredit the initial movement since I know little about what they were going through 
                 or how important it was to them. What I know is I won’t allow anyone to force me to join  this lost
                 course that modern day feminism is. Who is it helping? What good is it?  
                </p>
              <p class="two">
                This movement is bringing more harm than good to the society including to women.
                 Funny enough, it’s not about women. No. its about those who agree with it coz those who don’t, men or women, 
                 are all stupid, uncivilized and uninformed of the oppression of women. However, the oppression is never clear.
                  They complain of this and the other yet this and the other are nothing. Preferably, I call it a cult. People 
                  follow with or without reason and don’t want to be questioned. Its absurd though that even religion that has
                   existed for so long is questioned but radicle feminism cannot,
                 even when it is making no damn sense.

              </p>
                  <p class="three">
                    They tell us they are fighting for equality but when asked what rights men have that they don’t,
                     they instantly go mute. The response is a lame, ”that’s a good question” . Normally some will talk of female 
                     oppression and fail to accept the fact that women actually have it easier than men. They want to be praised for
                      all their wrong doings but condemn men for nothing, at times their mere existence. I would really wish to say that
                       not all feminism is bad but honestly speaking, 
                    this is 2023 and both men and women have the same rights and there is minimal discrimination on women in any fields. 



              </p>
                  <p class="four">
                    Its only fair to argue that men are the ones being discriminated.
                     For starters they are insulted for having an opinion. A stupid opinion such as #kill all men,
                      when said by a woman, she is being a strong woman/bad bitch. That’s actually contemplating genocide for 
                      life’s sake! If a man said something that they don’t agree with, he is being toxic and sexist.
                       Why on earth do we need such a thing? Talks of equality when the main purpose it to give women advantages
                        at the expense of men?  But then, that’s it.. that’s the actual aim of this radicle feminism. So then, as
                         a man of sane mind, why should I support such a thing. This is a society nuke that’s gonna destroy an entire
                          civilization in the near future if not checked. The sad thing is having to 
                    sit and see a group of unreasonable minority tear down society and everything our predecessors worked so hard to build.

               </p>
                  <p class="five">
                    A society works best when masculinity is operating at optimum and worst when its not.
                     The trick is, for masculinity to be at optimum femininity must be at its best level. 
                     Unfortunately, feminism is encouraging women to be masculine and emasculating men.
                      The goddamn truth is that if this succeeds at large scale then the society is doomed. 
                      
                      Feminism has nearly destroyed the family system. Women are boss babes now and, well, they don’t need men.
                       only to realize later that they were lied to. Unfortunately, by then they have hit the wall and their biological 
                       clock is showing them that their time is nearly out. By then they are less desirable since some have so much
                        emotional baggage. They end up crying on tiktok like lost toddlers yet they had the chance to make better
                         choices but decided to follow a lost course without thinking it through like sheep.
                     Its laughable but a disaster to the society.

              </p>
              <p class="six">
                I wonder how feminism has easily succeeded to convince young women into all sorts of wrong walks.
                 They tell them that’s it’s their body their choice only to come regret later when nobody wants them and 
                 complain of being insulted when called leftovers. The funny thing is that those who joined the movement before
                  them will tell them that that kind of life never ends well but these chicks cannot quit woke feminism.
                 Its like an addictive drug to them.


        </p>
            <p class="seven">
                Young women have been encouraged to wear any sorts of clothes. Some are walking ‘naked’. 
                That’s the worse level self-disrespect. I think the worthless things are the ones that are not well guarded.
                 Don’t be surprised when you see one of these naked ones with nothing else to offer other that their bodies 
                 complain of being sexualized and objectified as if they make is difficult to do so. That’s why I ask who is
                  benefitting from modern day feminism.
                 If it’s messing the lives of both men and women, I thinks its only wise to bring it to an end. What do you think?.
